Core Components:
Web Frontend: Built with Next.js and React, providing a user-friendly interface for note input and quiz display.

Next.js Orchestration Backend (/api/quizRag):

The central brain of the application.

Handles incoming requests from the frontend.

Manages the RAG pipeline (chunking, embedding, vector search).

Orchestrates calls to the separate AI Service Backend.

Interacts with MongoDB Atlas for persistent storage.

Integrates Redis for caching.

Utilizes LangChain.js for LLM orchestration and vector database integration.

Express AI Service Backend (server/index.js):

A lightweight Express.js application acting as a dedicated microservice for specific AI model inferences.

Exposes endpoints for:

/isQuestion: Calls a Hugging Face Transformer (mrsinghania/asr-question-detection) for question validation.

/generateDistractors: Calls Google Gemini 1.5 Pro for generating plausible incorrect answer options.

MongoDB Atlas:

quizCards Collection: Stores generated quiz cards (question, answers, options) for persistent storage.

noteChunks Collection: Stores chunks of original user notes along with their vector embeddings, serving as the knowledge base for RAG.

Atlas Vector Search Index: A specialized index on the noteChunks collection's embedding field, enabling efficient semantic similarity search (Approximate Nearest Neighbor - ANN).

Upstash Redis:

An ultra-fast, serverless, in-memory cache.

Used to store individual generated quiz cards for rapid retrieval, minimizing redundant AI calls and database lookups.

üß† AI & Machine Learning Core
ReNote's intelligence is powered by a sophisticated blend of AI techniques and models:

Large Language Models (LLMs): Utilizes Google Gemini models for various generative tasks.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):

Purpose: To ensure AI-generated content is accurate, contextually relevant, and grounded in the user's original notes, reducing "hallucinations."

Process:

Ingestion: User notes are split into smaller, overlapping chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

Embedding: Each text chunk is converted into a high-dimensional numerical vector (embedding) using Google Gemini Embeddings (embedding-001).

Vector Storage: These chunks and their embeddings are stored in the noteChunks collection in MongoDB Atlas.

Retrieval: When a quiz question needs AI processing (validation or distractor generation), the question itself is embedded. A MongoDB Atlas Vector Search query then finds the most semantically similar chunks from the stored notes.

Augmentation: The retrieved context (original text from relevant chunks) is dynamically added to the prompts sent to the LLMs.

Specialized AI Models:

Hugging Face Transformer (mrsinghania/asr-question-detection): A fine-tuned model specifically for classifying text as a valid question or not, ensuring high-quality input for quiz generation.

Google Gemini 1.5 Pro: A powerful generative model used for creating diverse and plausible incorrect answer options (distractors).

LangChain.js: Orchestrates the entire AI pipeline, managing text splitting, embedding calls, vector store interactions, and dynamic prompt construction for LLMs.

Prompt Engineering: Custom prompts are carefully designed to guide LLMs for specific tasks (e.g., distractor generation, question quality).

‚ö°Ô∏è Data Flow & Optimization
ReNote employs a multi-layered optimization strategy to maximize performance and minimize operational costs:

Individual Quiz Card Cache (Redis):

Key: originalNotesHash (SHA-256 hash of question\nanswer for each card).

Flow: When a quiz card is requested, Redis is checked first. If found, it's served instantly, bypassing all database and AI calls for that specific card.

Benefit: Highest hit rate for frequently repeated individual questions, providing lightning-fast responses.

Mechanism: node-redis client with setEx and get operations.

Individual Quiz Card Deduplication (MongoDB quizCards):

Key: originalNotesHash.

Flow: If not in Redis, MongoDB's quizCards collection is checked. If found, it's retrieved and then stored in Redis for future fast access.

Benefit: Prevents redundant AI calls (Hugging Face, Gemini 1.5 Pro) and database writes for quiz cards that have been generated before.

Full Notes Ingestion Deduplication (MongoDB noteChunks):

Key: originalFullNotesHash (SHA-256 hash of the entire input notes).

Flow: Before processing a new set of notes for RAG, this hash is checked in the noteChunks collection.

Benefit: Prevents re-chunking, re-embedding (saving Gemini Embeddings API costs), and re-storing the same entire set of notes in the vector database.

This layered approach ensures that resources are only utilized when necessary, providing a highly efficient and cost-effective solution.
